    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: November 2025</p>

    <p>These Terms of Service (the "Terms") govern your access to use of the website located at www.tiddwell.com and all related software, applications, data-import tools, and any other online and offline services provided by Tiddwell, LLC, a Washington limited liability company ("Tiddwell", "we", "our", or "us") (collectively, the "Services").</p>

    <p>By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Services on behalf of any organization, you represent that you are authorized to bind that organization, and "you" will refer to both you and the organization. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Services.</p>

    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>The Services allow users to manually enter, upload, import, or sync rental-related financial information, including income, expenses, and transaction details. The Services may organize entries into categories corresponding to IRS Schedule E for convenience in maintaining rental property records. The Services are not a tax preparation service, do not prepare or file any tax documents, and do not review, verify, audit, or certify the accuracy of your financial information. Tiddwell is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or authorized by the Internal Revenue Service. Tax preparers or accountants may use reports provided by users, but the Services do not provide separate accountant-access features at this time.</p>

    <p>The Services are not a property-management platform and do not manage leases, tenant communications, payments, maintenance, or compliance obligations.</p>

    <p>The Services are designed for individual rental property owners, small real estate investors, and their tax preparers. The Services are not intended for large property-management companies, enterprise real-estate portfolios, or users requiring more than five (5) Companies per account. Within the Services, a "Company" is an organization used to group properties, transactions, vendors, and reporting. A Company does not require an actual legal entity, business registration, or formal business structure. Users may name Companies in any manner they choose, including personal names, business names, or trust names.</p>

    <p>System limits apply to maintain performance and service quality. Each user may create up to five (5) Companies, each of which may contain up to twenty-five (25) properties and thirty (30) vendors. Additional capacity is not included in the Services and may require a separate agreement. For clarity, property and vendor limits apply to each individual Company, not across your entire account.</p>

    <p>Each Company is isolated from others within your account. Data in one Company is not shared with, visible to, or accessible from any other Company.</p>

    <h2>2. Content</h2>
    <p>No content made available or generated through the Services ("Content") may be reproduced, transferred, sold, licensed, published, publicly displayed, linked, broadcast, or distributed to any third party, unless otherwise expressly permitted in these Terms, in writing by us, or by the tools made available in the Services. If you copy, reproduce, or retransmit any part of our Content in breach of these Terms, your right to use our Services will cease immediately and you must, at our option, return, destroy, or recall any copies of the Content you have made.</p>

    <p>All Content is intended for informational purposes only. While we strive to produce accurate organizational tools, we do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, usefulness, or correctness of any Content, including automated categorizations, imported data, or Schedule E-aligned reports. Tiddwell is not responsible for decisions you make based on the Content or Services, including tax filings, financial reporting, or rental-property decisions.</p>

    <p>You understand that Content may be incomplete, delayed, incorrectly categorized, duplicated, or missing due to limitations inherent in data-import tools (including bank feeds), manual entry, or third-party systems.</p>

    <h2>3. No Tax, Accounting, or Financial Advice</h2>
    <p>The Services are an administrative tool for organizing rental income and expenses. We do not provide tax, accounting, legal, financial, or investment advice. The organization of entries into IRS Schedule E categories is provided solely for your convenience and does not constitute tax preparation, tax filing, or tax advice. The IRS does not review or endorse the Services. Reports generated by the Services are formatted for convenience and are not official IRS forms. Tiddwell does not prepare or file taxes or interact with IRS systems.</p>

    <p>You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy and completeness of all data used for tax or financial purposes, and for compliance with federal, state, and local tax laws. You should consult a qualified tax professional before relying on any Content or Outputs (defined below) for filing, compliance, or financial reporting.</p>

    <p>Tiddwell does not represent or warrant that any report, export, category, or classification generated by the Services will satisfy IRS requirements or be accepted by any tax authority.</p>

    <h2>4. Bank Feeds, Data Import, and Automated Categorization</h2>
    <p>The Services may allow you to import or sync financial data through third-party providers (e.g., bank-feed integrations). Bank-feed integrations may require the use of a business-level data-aggregation provider. This does not require you to have a business bank account or a registered business entity. These connections are established between Tiddwell and the data provider at the Company level, not as personal consumer financial accounts. Imported data may be delayed, incomplete, inaccurate, corrupted, duplicated, or unavailable. You are solely responsible for reviewing and correcting categorizations, including any categories aligned with Schedule E. Tiddwell does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, or completeness of imported transactions, balances, or other financial data. Any automated categorization, recommendation, or label is for convenience only and may be inaccurate or inappropriate for your circumstances. You must independently verify all data before using it for tax, accounting, or financial reporting. Bank-feed providers and financial institutions may delay, reject, or throttle access to data, and Tiddwell has no control over such actions.</p>

    <h2>5. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Each account is for a single user only. The Services do not currently support multi-user access to a Company's data (including accountant-only access, shared user access, or delegated permissions). You are responsible for maintaining exclusive control over your login credentials and for all activity under your account.</p>

    <p>You are solely responsible for the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Entering accurate, complete, and lawful information into the Services, including any rental income, expenses, transaction descriptions, classifications, and property details;</li>
        <li>Reviewing all imported, synced, categorized, or auto-suggested data for accuracy and appropriateness before relying on it;</li>
        <li>Maintaining your own backup copies of your financial, rental, and tax records outside of the Services. Tiddwell is not a data-backup or archival service;</li>
        <li>Verifying that all information used for tax filings, accounting, financial statements, or compliance with IRS or state/local requirements is correct;</li>
        <li>Ensuring that any login credentials, bank-feed credentials, or authentication information used with the Services are kept secure and not shared with unauthorized users;</li>
        <li>Ensuring your compliance with all federal, state, and local landlord, tenant, rental, tax, and bookkeeping regulations applicable to you; and</li>
        <li>Keeping your account information (including email, phone, billing information, and property information) current and accurate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Inputs, Outputs, and Ownership</h2>
    <p>You may enter, upload, import, or sync certain financial, transactional, or property-related information into the Services (collectively, the "Inputs"). You represent that you have all rights necessary to provide these Inputs and that doing so does not violate any laws, lease agreements, financial-institution terms, privacy obligations, or other third-party rights. You retain ownership of your Inputs.</p>

    <p>The Services may generate certain calculations, categorizations, reports, summaries, or other informational materials based on your Inputs (collectively, the "Outputs"). Outputs may be incomplete, inaccurate, incorrect, mislabeled, inconsistently categorized, or otherwise inappropriate for your specific circumstances. Outputs may also depend on incomplete or inaccurate Inputs, bank-feed data, or third-party information. You are solely responsible for reviewing and verifying the accuracy, completeness, and appropriateness of all Outputs before relying on them for any purpose, including tax filings, financial reporting, bookkeeping, compliance, or decision-making.</p>

    <p>As between you and Tiddwell, you own the Outputs, subject to Tiddwell's underlying intellectual property. Outputs exclude Tiddwell IP such as templates, schemas, formats, or system-generated structure.</p>

    <p>To operate, maintain, and improve the Services, you grant Tiddwell a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, store, process, transmit, analyze, display, and use Inputs and Outputs as necessary to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>provide and improve the Services;</li>
        <li>maintain security and integrity;</li>
        <li>operate data import and bank-feed integrations;</li>
        <li>develop internal analytics and aggregated insights (in anonymized form); and</li>
        <li>comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Tiddwell will not sell your Inputs or Outputs and will only use them in accordance with these Terms and our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>Any machine-generated categorizations, summaries, or suggestions are provided for convenience only and may be incomplete, inaccurate or inappropriate.</p>

    <p>You acknowledge that Tiddwell does not verify the accuracy, legality, or completeness of any Inputs.</p>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Services and Content (excluding your Inputs and Outputs), software, trademarks, logos, designs, user interface, workflows, and all associated intellectual property ("Tiddwell IP") are owned by Tiddwell or its licensors. Nothing in these Terms transfers ownership of Tiddwell IP to you.</p>

    <p>You may not:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works of Tiddwell IP;</li>
        <li>reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the Services; or</li>
        <li>use the Services for competitive benchmarking or to build a competing product.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All rights not expressly granted are reserved.</p>

    <p>You may not remove or obscure any copyright, trademark, or proprietary notices.</p>

    <h2>8. Payments and Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>If you subscribe to paid Services, you authorize Tiddwell or its third-party payment processor to charge your chosen payment method for applicable fees, taxes, and charges. Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless you cancel before the renewal date. By purchasing a subscription, you agree to recurring charges until you cancel.</p>

    <p>The Unlimited Plan is intended for legitimate use by individual users or small businesses managing their own properties. Prohibited activities include reselling or redistributing reports, automated or bulk report generation, account sharing, and any use deemed abusive in our sole discretion. Violation may result in suspension or termination without refund.</p>

    <p>If we offer a trial, it will convert to a paid subscription unless cancelled before the end of the trial period.</p>

    <p>We may change subscription pricing with prior notice to your account email address. Continued use after the price change constitutes acceptance. If required by applicable law, we will provide you with advance notice of any renewal terms or price changes.</p>

    <p>Summary Reports are provided at no cost. Detail Reports organized by Schedule E categories are a paid feature and are billed on a per-property basis. Detail Reports are billed per property. Generating a Detail Report for each property requires payment even if the property is within the same Company. If a Detail Report is generated and downloaded and the related payment is later reversed (including through chargeback), Tiddwell may immediately suspend or close your account.</p>

    <p>Except as required by law, all fees are non-refundable.</p>

    <h2>9. Prohibited Uses</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Access or use the Services in any unlawful manner or for any unlawful purpose;</li>
        <li>Use automated tools to scrape, extract, or download data from the Services without permission;</li>
        <li>Misrepresent the nature or source of any data generated by the Services;</li>
        <li>Attempt to access or interfere with non-public systems, security features, or technical protections;</li>
        <li>Use the Services to transmit malware, spam, or harmful content;</li>
        <li>Circumvent access controls, account limits, rate limits, or security protocols;</li>
        <li>Collect personal information of other users without authorization;</li>
        <li>Engage in any conduct that interferes with or disrupts the functioning of the Services;</li>
        <li>Use the Services, Content, or Outputs to develop, train, or improve models, datasets, products, or services that compete with Tiddwell;</li>
        <li>Represent Outputs as human-generated if they were generated by automated systems or Services; and</li>
        <li>Use the Services to manage more than five (5) Companies per account, more than twenty-five (25) properties per Company, or more than thirty (30) vendors per Company, unless expressly approved by Tiddwell. Enterprise-scale data ingestion, bulk-import tools designed for portfolios exceeding the stated limits, or automated high-volume transaction processing are not permitted without a separate written agreement. Using automation or scripts to create or manage Companies, properties, or vendors beyond stated system limits is prohibited.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, CONTENT, INPUTS, AND OUTPUTS IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TIDDWELL DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ACCURACY OF DATA, IMPORTS, OR CATEGORIZATIONS, AVAILABILITY OR RELIABILITY OF BANK FEEDS, AND COMPLIANCE WITH IRS, STATE, OR LOCAL TAX REQUIREMENTS. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, TIMELY, ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY REPORT, EXPORT, CATEGORY, OR SCHEDULE E ALIGNMENT IS SUITABLE FOR TAX FILING OR WILL BE ACCEPTED BY THE IRS OR ANY TAX AUTHORITY. WE DO NOT REVIEW, VERIFY, OR AUDIT YOUR INPUTS OR OUTPUTS.</p>

    <p>You acknowledge that:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Imported data may be delayed, incomplete, inaccurate, duplicated, or missing;</li>
        <li>Automated categorizations or suggestions are informational only and may be wrong; and</li>
        <li>You are solely responsible for verifying all information before using it for tax, accounting, financial, or compliance purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Tiddwell is not responsible for harm arising from telecommunications failures, bank-feed disruptions, third-party outages, server issues, or data loss.</p>

    <p>Some states, including Washington, may limit the effectiveness of certain disclaimers; however, the disclaimers herein will apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>

    <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TIDDWELL WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR REVENUE, COST OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, TAX PENALTIES OR TAX-RELATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM INACCURATE DATA, MISCLASSIFICATION, OR USER RELIANCE ON THE SERVICES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS APPLY WHETHER THE CLAIM IS BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY.</p>

    <p>OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM AROSE, OR (B) ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).</p>

    <p>The limitation of liability set forth above is a fundamental basis of the bargain, applies to all claims, and survives termination of these Terms.</p>

    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of liability. In those jurisdictions, our liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted.</p>

    <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Tiddwell and its members, managers, officers, employees, and agents from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, penalties, costs, or expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Your use of the Services, including reliance on any categorization, report, or bank-feed data;</li>
        <li>Your tax filings, financial reporting, landlord activities, or compliance obligations;</li>
        <li>Your violation of any law or regulation;</li>
        <li>Your Inputs or any data you upload, import, or sync;</li>
        <li>Your breach of these Terms;</li>
        <li>Your use of any Outputs for tax, accounting, legal, or financial purposes without independent verification.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Tiddwell reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense of any matter subject to indemnification.</p>

    <p>This indemnity applies to claims brought by government entities, tax authorities, financial institutions, tenants, or third parties arising from your use of the Services.</p>

    <h2>13. Data Retention and No Fiduciary Duties</h2>
    <p>Tiddwell is not a data-backup service. We may retain or delete data at our discretion in accordance with our internal policies. You are solely responsible for maintaining your own copies of all financial records, tax documents, and rental-related information outside the Services. When you delete records within the Services, they are soft deleted (not immediately removed) to preserve financial and reporting integrity. Soft-deleted data remains accessible to you until account deletion.</p>

    <p>Your use of the Services does not create any fiduciary, professional, accountant-client, or advisor-client relationship. Tiddwell does not act as your accountant, your tax preparer, your bookkeeper, your financial advisor, or your legal counsel. Nothing in these Services should be interpreted as creating any heightened duty of care. You agree that Tiddwell does not owe you any fiduciary duty and does not act as your agent, accountant, or representative.</p>

    <h2>14. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Services may integrate with or rely on third-party providers, including bank-feed aggregators, financial data providers, authentication providers, and hosting and infrastructure services.</p>

    <p>Tiddwell does not control and is not responsible for:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>the accuracy, completeness, or availability of third-party data;</li>
        <li>delays or failures in importing transactions;</li>
        <li>third-party service outages or errors; and</li>
        <li>security, privacy, and data-handling practices of third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your use of third-party services is governed by their own terms, not ours. Tiddwell is not liable for any loss caused by third-party services, including bank-feed interruptions, transmission errors, or inaccurate financial data.</p>

    <h2>15. Termination and Enforcement</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time if:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>you violate these Terms;</li>
        <li>you engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity;</li>
        <li>your payment method fails; or</li>
        <li>your use threatens the security or operation of these Services.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may stop using the Services at any time.</p>

    <p>Upon termination:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>your license to use the Services ends immediately;</li>
        <li>we may retain or delete data per our internal policies; and</li>
        <li>all sections intended to survive (including disclaimers, liability limits, and indemnities) will survive.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We reserve the right to investigate violations of these Terms and may access, read, preserve, or disclose any information we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law, protect our rights, address fraud or security issues, or enforce these Terms.</p>

    <h2>16. Arbitration</h2>
    <p>Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Services shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall take place in Clark County, Washington, and the language of the arbitration shall be English. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Tiddwell agree to waive any right to a jury trial or to participate in a class action. The prevailing party in any arbitration shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs from the non-prevailing party. If any portion of this arbitration provision is found unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will remain in effect.</p>

    <h2>17. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.</p>

    <h2>18. Modifications</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If changes are material, we will notify you by email or through the Services. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of any modifications constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the modified Terms, your sole remedy is to stop using the Services.</p>

    <h2>19. Eligibility and Account Verification</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old. If you are under 18, you may not access or use the Services. Additionally, you agree to provide accurate and complete information about yourself during the registration process and to update such information as necessary. You further represent and warrant that you possess the legal authority and capacity to engage in transactions and that any payment method you provide is valid and under your sole control.</p>

    <h2>20. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>These Terms are the entire agreement between you and Tiddwell. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of valid jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms shall remain in full force and effect and shall be enforced to the fullest extent allowed under applicable law. No waiver or failure by us to enforce any provision of the Terms shall be valid unless in writing and signed by an officer of Tiddwell. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. We may assign or transfer these Terms at our sole discretion without restriction and notice to you. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns. Headings in the Terms are purely for reference and shall not affect the meaning of any term or condition. These Terms do not create a joint venture, partnership, or employment relationship.</p>
